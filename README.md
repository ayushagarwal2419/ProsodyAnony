The subjective study was done to show that it is difficult for the humans to identify the original and anonymized speaker. 10 listeners were taken and the study was done on the TIMIT dataset. 2 speech utterance of different linguistic content (SA1.wav and SA2.wav) of 4 speakers from the TIMIT dataset were taken. Both the utterance of every speaker were prosody modified with α = 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5. Therefore, we have a set of 2×4×4 = 32 speech utterances. For both the study, at a time two speech utterances were played and listeners were asked to give the score according to the criteria of the study 1 or study 2.

## Study 1
In this study the listeners should tell whether the speech file belong to the same speaker or the different speaker. Both the original file and anonymized speech utterance had same content so that the listeners had only the speaker's identity to compare. When listener predicts that the pair belongs to same speaker then score is 1 otherwise it is 0.

## Study 2

In study 2, we want the listeners to rate how dis-similar is the anonymized speech from the original speech. Original speech utterance is compared with the prosody modified case and the listener has to give the score in the range 1-5. Ratings are : 1 - Exactly same, 2 - Very similar, 3 - Confusion between same and different, 4 - Different, 5 - Completely different. Further mean opinion score (MOS) is computed.
